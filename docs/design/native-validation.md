# Native GNOME validation log

2026-10-19, GNOME Shell 50.1, Wayland. Logical monitor reported as 1728×972. The user logged in again; `gnome-extensions info` confirms Archsport v14 and matci v11 are ACTIVE. The next source candidates are v15/v12 and require their own native reload after staging.

## Verification completed

- Source syntax, Python/Node tests, schema dry run, CSS generation check and local byte comparison of shared tokens passed.
- `Clutter.AnimationMode.EASE_OUT_QUART` and `EASE_OUT_CUBIC` are present in the installed Clutter 18 typelib.
- GNOME interface currently reports `color-scheme='default'`, `gtk-theme='Yaru-purple'`, and animations enabled. The code selects the light expanded variant in this appearance.
- Code inspection confirms the existing shared dock outside-click logic and matci `keepReview: true` path are preserved. Both dock implementations now use the same motion duration and easing tokens.
- After the screen unlocked, the screenshot portal captured the **old installed** v11/v8 panel. The cropped baseline is `docs/design/iterations/00-before-panel-gnome50.png`; the full-desktop capture was removed.
- The user supplied native crops of the v14/v11 expanded UI: excess blank space in matci and a gray rectangular shadow visible beside a rounded Archsport corner. The v15/v12 source reduces widths and padding, sizes the matci list viewport from its content, rounds all four outer corners, and removes the outer shadow. The visual outcome is still unverified.

## Native visual gate pending

The desktop initially reported `org.gnome.ScreenSaver.GetActive = true`. Both `gnome-screenshot` and the screenshot portal returned a black image while locked; those captures were discarded. After the user's relogin, the v14/v11 surfaces are loaded. The tighter v15/v12 source is not loaded yet, so its appearance and motion are not claimed.

After unlock and the staged update applies at the next GNOME login, capture and inspect at least three iterations of the following actual GNOME states, saving only cropped UI evidence under `docs/design/iterations/`:

| Archsport | matci |
| --- | --- |
| idle panel, compact live, expanded live, goal event, schedule, multiple games, error | panel, overview, app list, selected apps, review, result, error |

Then validate 100/125/150% scaling, input including right/middle/side clicks, repeated open/close, cross-app ownership, overview/fullscreen, suspend/resume, lifecycle and 30-minute CPU/GPU/RSS before producing `final-apple-audit.png`. The worker/API paths must remain unchanged. Inspect relevant redacted `journalctl --user -b -o short-precise` errors after the actual run.
